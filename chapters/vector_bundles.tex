\chapter{Vector Bundles}\label{chap:vector_bundles}
The discussion in this chapter is based on the Chapters 2,3,4 of \cite{char_class} and its goal is first to investigate the notion of vector bundles and the additional structure they provide, when compared to the general fiber bundles (see Appendix~\ref{app:fiber_bundles}). At the end of this chapter, for each vector bundle the associated ``Stiefel-Whitney classes'' is defined to be some sequence of elements in the cohomology ring of the base space, one for each dimension. As they are defined to be invariant under bundle isomorphisms, they can be used to distinguish between non-isomorphic vector bundles.

\section{Basic Notions}
Let us begin with the definition of a vector bundle. This will be the same as Definition~\ref{def:fiber_bundle}, differing only on two aspects. First of all the fibers are now vector spaces and secondly the homeomorphisms making the total space locally trivial are now linear isomorphisms over each fiber:

\begin{definition}\label{def:vector_bundle} Let $E$ and $B$ be some topological spaces and $n\in\mathbb{N}$. A continuous map $\xi:E\to B$ is called an \ul{$\mathbb{R}^n$-vector bundle} or \ul{$n$-plane bundle}, if for every $x\in B$ the set $\xi^{-1}(x)$ is a vector space and also for every $x\in B$ there exists an open neighborhood $x\in U\subseteq B$, and a continuous map $f_U:\xi^{-1}(U)\to U\times\mathbb{R}^n$ (where $\xi^{-1}(U)$ has the subspace topology and $U\times\mathbb{R}^n$ the product topology), such that:
\begin{i_enum}
\item $f_U$ is a homeomorphism.
\item  $\xi|_{\xi^{-1}(U)}=\pi_1\circ f_U$, i.e. the following diagram commutes:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
E\ar[r,"\supseteq",phantom]&[-1.5em]\xi^{-1}(U)\ar[d,"\xi|_{\xi^{-1}(U)}"']\ar[r,"f_U"]&U\times\mathbb{R}^n\ar[dl,"\pi_1"]\\[2em]
B\ar[r,"\supseteq",phantom]&U
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
\item $f_U|_{\xi^{-1}(x)}:\xi^{-1}(x)\to\{x\}\times\mathbb{R}^n$ is linear for every $x\in U$.
\end{i_enum}
$B$ is then called \ul{base space} and $E$ \ul{total space} of the vector bundle. Moreover, for every $x\in B$, the space $\xi^{-1}(x)$ is called \ul{the fiber over $x$}.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark} Since for every $x\in B$ $f_U:U\to U\times\mathbb{R}^n$ is a homeomorphism, Proposition~\ref{prop:same_fiber} gives us that $\xi^{-1}(x)\cong\mathbb{R}$ as topological spaces through $f_U|_{\xi^{-1}(x)}$ and since $f_U|_{\xi^{-1}(x)}$ is also linear, $\xi^{-1}(x)\cong\mathbb{R}^n$ as vector spaces. So, we can visualize the total space $E$ of the fiber bundle $\xi$ as a collection of $n$-planes, parametrized continuously by elements of $B$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}\label{rem:vector_subcover} Let $E\overset{\xi}{\to} B$ be a fiber bundle, $x\in B$ and $U\subseteq B$ an open neighborhood of $x$, $f_U:p^{-1}(U)\to U\times\mathbb{R}^n$ a homeomorphism as in the Definition~\ref{def:vector_bundle}, i.e. it makes the following diagram commute and is linear over each fiber:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\xi^{-1}(U)\ar[d,"\xi|_{\xi^{-1}(U)}"']\ar[r,"f_U"]&U\times\mathbb{R}^n\ar[dl,"\pi_1"]\\
U
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
Moreover, let $V\subseteq U$ be some other open neighborhood of $x$. Then, $f_V:=f_U|_{\xi^{-1}(V)}$ is a homeomorphism between $\xi^{-1}(V)$ and $V\times\mathbb{R}^n$ as in the Definition~\ref{def:vector_bundle}, i.e. it makes its associated diagram commute and is linear over each fiber. Indeed, using Remark~\ref{rem:fiber_subcover} we can prove that this makes the associated diagram commute. Since it is a restriction of $f_U$, which is linear over each fiber, $f_V$ is also linear over each fiber and thus satisfies the restrictions of Definition~\ref{def:vector_bundle}.
\end{remark}

Let us now list some examples of vector bundles:
\begin{examples}
\begin{i_enum}
\item For any topological space $B$ and any $n\in\mathbb{N}$ we have the following \emph{trivial} vector bundle:
\[\varepsilon_B^n:B\times\mathbb{R}^n\to B\]
which is the projection on the first coordinate.
\item Let $M$ be a smooth $n$-manifold then its \emph{tangent bundle} $\tau_M:TM\to M$ is the $n$-plane bundle constructed as follows: Let $(U_{\alpha})_{\alpha\in I}$ be an open cover of $M$ and $\mathcal{A}=\big\{(U_{\alpha},\phi_{\alpha}:U_{\alpha}\to\mathbb{R}^n)_{\alpha\in I}\big\}$ be a smooth atlas of $M$. Fix any point $x\in M$ and some $(U,\phi)\in\mathcal{A}$ such that $x\in U$. Then we define the tangent space at $x$ to be the set of all possible \emph{tangent vectors} at $x$ inside $M$, i.e. the following set of equivalence classes:
\[T_xM:=\faktor{\left\{\gamma:\mathbb{R}\to M\ |\ \gamma(0)=x\text{ and }\phi\circ\gamma\text{ smooth}\right\}}{\sim}\]
where $\gamma_1\sim\gamma_2$ iff $(\phi\circ\gamma_1)'(0)=(\phi\circ\gamma_2)'(0)$. This set can be given an $\mathbb{R}$-vector space structure as follows:
\[\lambda_1\cdot[\gamma_1]+\lambda_2\cdot[\gamma_2]:=\left[\phi^{-1}\circ\big(\lambda_1(\phi\circ\gamma_1)+\lambda_2(\phi\circ\gamma_2)\big)\right]\]
Notice that $T_xM$ does not depend on the choice of $(U,\phi)\in\mathcal{A}$. Indeed, since the atlas is smooth and $U_{\alpha}$ are open, every transition map $\phi_{\alpha}\circ\phi_{\beta}:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^n$ has an invertible Jacobi matrix and thus the equivalence relation is the same under any $\phi$. Then, we define the total space of the tangent bundle of $M$ to be the set of all possible tangent vectors at any point of $M$, i.e. the following set:
\[TM:=\big\{(x,[\gamma]):x\in M\text{ and }[\gamma]\in T_xM\big\}\]
We now topologize this set as follows: Fix some $(U,\phi)\in\mathbb{A}$, then we define the following map:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
TM\ar[r,phantom,"\supseteq"]&[-2em]\pi_1^{-1}(U)\ar[r]&U\times\mathbb{R}^n\\[-1.5em]
&(x,[\gamma])\ar[r,mapsto]&(x,(\phi\circ\gamma)'(0))
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
This induces a topology on $\pi_1^{-1}(U)$ and since the transition maps are open maps, this topology is well defined on every $U_{\alpha}\cap U_{\beta}$. This defines a topology on $TM$. The vector bundle $\tau_{M}:TM\to M$ is exactly the function $\pi_1(x,[\gamma])=x$ we used above, so the local triviality is true by the definition of the topology.
\item Let $M$ be a smooth $n$-manifold embedded in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Then its \emph{normal bundle} $\nu_{M,d}:N_dM\to M$ is the $d-n$-plane bundle \emph{orthogonal} to $\tau_M$, i.e.
\[N_dM:=\big\{(x,v)\in M\times\mathbb{R}^d:x\in M\text{ and }\forall[\gamma]\in T_xM\ v\perp\gamma'(0)\in\mathbb{R}^d\big\}\]
and it is easy to see how the fibers are vector spaces and how the total space is topologised. The vector bundle $\nu_{M,d}$ is again the projection on the first coordinate, but notice that this vector bundle depends on the ambient space the $M$ lives in, while the tangent bundle we defined above is an intrinsic construction, i.e. independent of any embedding.
\item There exists a natural $1$-plane bundle (also: \emph{line bundle}) over each $n$ dimensional real projective space: the \emph{tautological} line bundle
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\gamma_n^1:\big\{(l,v)\in\mathbb{R}P^n\times\mathbb{R}^{n+1}:v\in l\big\}\ar[r]&\mathbb{R}P^n\\[-1.5em]
(l,v)\ar[r,mapsto]&l
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
The total space of this bundle is topologised as a subspace of $\mathbb{R}P^n\times\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, where the $n$-dimensional projective space is defined to be the set of all lines through the origin in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, topologized as the following quotient:
\[\mathbb{R}P^n=\{l\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n+1}:l\text{ vector space with }\dim l=1\}\cong\faktor{S^n}{x\sim-x}\]
We need to show that the total space is locally homeomorphic to a trivial bundle with the homeomorphism being linear isomorphism on each fiber. We use the standard open cover of $\mathbb{R}P^n$ which makes it a manifold, the one we also used in Lemma~\ref{lem:gr_manifold}: Let $l\in\mathbb{R}P^n$ and define $U:=\{l'\in\mathbb{R}P:l'\cap l^{\perp}=\{0\}\}$. Fix also some $v\in l\setminus\{0\}$. Then, we can define $f_U:(\gamma_n^1)^{-1}(U)\to\mathbb{R}P^n\times\mathbb{R}$ as follows:
\[f_U(l',v')=(l',v'^tv)\]
this is continuous and linear over each fiber and since $v'^tv\neq0$ for $v'\neq0$, $f_U$ is also a homeomorphism.
\end{i_enum}
\end{examples}

Now that we have seen some examples for the objects we are interested in, it is time to define morphisms between these objects, in order to be able to differentiate them and construct new ones from old. Compared to the Definition~\ref{def:bundle_map} of the bundle map, we also need for it to respect the vector space structure over each fiber.

\begin{definition}
Let $\xi_1:E_1\to B$ be an $n$-plane vector bundle and $\xi_2:E_2\to B$ be an $m$-plane vector bundle. A continuous map $\phi:E_1\to E_2$ is a \ul{vector bundle map from $\xi_1$ to $\xi_2$ over $B$}, if
\begin{i_enum}
\item $\xi_1=\xi_2\circ\phi$, i.e. if the following diagram commutes:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
E_1\ar[rd,"\xi_1"']\ar[rr,"\phi"]&[-2em]&[-2em]E_2\ar[ld,"\xi_2"]\\
&B
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
\item $\phi|_{\xi_1^{-1}(x)}:\xi_1^{-1}(x)\to\xi_2^{-1}(x)$ is linear for every $x\in B$.
\end{i_enum}
\end{definition}
\begin{remark} Using Proposition~\ref{prop:fiberwise}, we can characterize vector bundle maps by their local behavior: Let $\phi:E_1\to E_2$ be a continuous map. Then, $\phi$ is a vector bundle map if and only if
\begin{i_enum}
\item $\phi|_{\xi_1^{-1}(x)}(\xi_1^{-1}(x))\subseteq\xi_2^{-1}(x)$ for every $x\in B$ and
\item $\phi|_{\xi_1^{-1}}:\xi_1^{-1}(x)\to\xi_2^{-1}(x)$ is linear for every $x\in B$.
\end{i_enum}
\end{remark}

\begin{definition} Let $\xi_1:E_1\to B$ be an $n$-plane bundle and $\xi_2:E_2\to B$ be an $m$-plane bundle and let $\phi:E_1\to E_2$ be a vector bundle map from $\xi_1$ to $\xi_2$ over $B$. The map $\phi$ is called a \emph{vector bundle isomorphism} if $\phi$ is a homeomorphism.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}\label{rem:global_to_local_iso_vector} Using Proposition~\ref{prop:global_to_local_iso} we deduce that a vector bundle isomorphism $\phi$ induces a homeomorphism $\xi_1^{-1}(x)\cong\xi_2^{-1}(x)$ over each fiber. Since $\phi|_{\xi_1^{-1}(x)}$ is also linear, $\xi_1^{-1}(x)\cong\xi_2^{-1}(x)$ as vector spaces and thus $n=m$.
\end{remark}

Up to this point, our discussion about vector bundles mirrors the discussion on the fiber bundles of Appendix~\ref{app:fiber_bundles}. The fact that each fiber is a vector space is just an additional structure we carry around through the definitions. The next proposition however is indicative of how much more restrictive the notion of a vector bundle is. In particular we directly prove that an inverse of Remark~\ref{rem:global_to_local_iso_vector} is always true. Compare this to counterexample~\ref{ex:counterexample} and Theorem~\ref{thm:local_to_global_iso}.

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:local_to_global_iso_vector} Let $\xi_1:E_1\to B$ and $\xi_2:E_2\to B$ be two $n$-plane vector bundles. Moreover, let $\phi:E_1\to E_2$ be a vector bundle map such that its restriction
\[\phi_x:\xi_1^{-1}(x)\to\xi_2^{-1}(x)\]
with $\phi_x(v)=\phi(v)$ is a vector space isomorphism for every $x\in B$. Then $\phi$ is also a homeomorphism and thus a vector bundle isomorphism.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof} First of all, it is easy to see that $\phi$ is a bijection:
\begin{itemize}
\item Let $u_1,u_2\in E_1$ and $\phi(u_1)=\phi(u_2)$. Since $\phi$ is a vector bundle map, we have:
\[\xi_1(u_1)=\xi_2(\phi(u_1))=\xi_2(\phi(u_2))=\xi_1(u_2)=:x_0\]
So, $u_1,u_2\in\xi_1^{-1}(x_0)$ and $\phi_{x_0}(u_1)=\phi(u_1)=\phi(u_2)=\phi_{x_0}(u_2)$. Since $\phi_{x_0}$ is injective, $u_1=u_2$, which proves that $\phi$ is injective as well.
\item Let $v\in E_2$. For $x_0:=p_2(v)$, we have that $v\in\xi)2^{-1}(x_0)$. Since $\phi_{x_0}$ is surjective, there exists some $u\in\xi_1^{-1}(x_0)\subseteq E_1$ with $\phi(u)=\phi_{x_0}(u)=v$, proving that $\phi$ is also surjective.
\end{itemize}
It now remains to prove that $\phi^{-1}$ is continuous as well. For every $x\in B$, there exist open neighborhoods $U_1,U_2$ of $x$, such that $\xi_1^{-1}(U_1)$ is isomorphic to $U_1\times\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\xi_2^{-1}(U_2)$ is isomorphic to $U_2\times\mathbb{R}^n$, satisfying the commutative diagrams of the Definition~\ref{def:vector_bundle}. Let $U_x:=U_1\cap U_2$. Then, as seen in Remark~\ref{rem:vector_subcover}, $U$ satisfies the requirements of the \ref{def:vector_bundle}. This means that there exist homeomorphisms $(f_1)_{U_x}:\xi_1^{-1}(U_x)\to U_x\times\mathbb{R}^n$ and $(f_2)_{U_x}:\xi_2^{-1}(U_x)\to U_x\times\mathbb{R}^n$ making the following diagrams commute and being linear over each fiber:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\xi_1^{-1}(U_x)\ar[d,"\xi_1|_{\xi_1^{-1}(U_x)}"']\ar[r,"(f_1)_{U_x}"]&U_x\times\mathbb{R}^n\ar[dl,"\pi_1"]&&
\xi_2^{-1}(U_x)\ar[d,"\xi_2|_{\xi_2^{-1}(U_x)}"']\ar[r,"(f_2)_{U_x}"]&U_x\times\mathbb{R}^n\ar[dl,"\pi_1"]\\
U&&&U
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
Let $\mathcal{U}=\{U_x:x\in B\}$. Since $\{\xi_2^{-1}(U):U\in\mathcal{U}\}$ forms an open cover of $E_2$, it suffices to show that $\phi^{-1}|_{\xi_2^{-1}(U)}$ is continuous for every $U\in\mathcal{U}$ and then apply the glueing lemma. Let us fix such a $U\in\mathcal{U}$. Then, the above commutative diagrams let us define the map $\psi:U\times\mathbb{R}\to U\times\mathbb{R}$ as the following composition:
\vspace*{-1em}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
U\times\mathbb{R}^n\ar[r,"\cong"',"(f_1)_U^{-1}"]\ar[drr,"\pi_1"',near start]\ar[rrrr,bend left=15,dotted,"\psi"]&[2em]\xi_1^{-1}(U)\ar[rr,"\phi|_{\xi_1^{-1}(U)}"]\ar[dr,"\xi_1"',near start]&[-1em]&[-1em]\xi_2^{-1}(U)\ar[r,"\cong"',"(f_2)_U"]\ar[dl,"\xi_2",near start]&[2em]U\times\mathbb{R}^n\ar[dll,"\pi_1",near start]\\[2em]
&&U
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
This means that the map $\psi$ has the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\psi$ is continuous and a bijection.
\item For every $x\in U$ there exists some linear map $\psi_x:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\psi(x,v)=(x,\psi_x(v))$. Moreover, $\psi_x\in GL(n)$, since the following diagram commutes for every $x\in U$:
\vspace*{-1em}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\mathbb{R}^n\ar[r,"\cong"']\ar[rrrrr,bend left=15,"\psi_x"]&\{x\}\times\mathbb{R}^n\ar[r,"\cong"']&\xi_1^{-1}(x)\ar[r,"\cong"',"\phi_x"]&\xi_2^{-1}(x)\ar[r,"\cong"']&\{x\}\times\mathbb{R}^n\ar[r,"\cong"']&\mathbb{R}^n
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
\item $\phi^{-1}|_{\xi_2^{-1}(U)}=(\phi|_{\xi_1^{-1}(U)})^{-1}$ is continuous if and only if $\psi^{-1}$ is continuous.
\end{itemize}
Essentially, we have reduced the problem to the case of $E_1,E_2$ both being the trivial vector bundle $U\times\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\psi:U\times\mathbb{R}^n\to U\times\mathbb{R}^n$.

We now want to prove that the function $U\to GL(n)$ with $x\mapsto\psi_x$ is continuous. Let us fix a basis $e_1,\ldots,e_n$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and write $\psi_x=(a_{i,j}(x))_{i,j\in[n]}\in GL(n)$ as a matrix in that basis. Then, it suffices to prove that $a_{i,j}:U\to\mathbb{R}$ is continuous for every $i,j\in[n]$, since $GL(n)$ is topologised as a subset of $\mathbb{R}^{n^2}$. This is true, since $a_{i,j}$ can be written as the following composition:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
U\ar[r,hook]&U\times\mathbb{R}^n\ar[r,"\psi"]&U\times\mathbb{R}^n\ar[r,"\pi_2"]&\mathbb{R}^n\ar[r,two heads,"\pi_i"]&\mathbb{R}\\[-1.5em]
x\ar[r,mapsto]&(x,e_j)\ar[r,mapsto]&(x,\psi_xe_j)\ar[r,mapsto]&\psi_xe_j\ar[r,mapsto]&e_i^t\psi_xe_j\ar[r,phantom,"="]&[-2em]a_{i,j}(x)
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}

Now, notice that $GL(n)$ is a topological group, so the inverse function is continuous, i.e. the function $U\to GL(n)$ with $x\mapsto\psi_x^{-1}$ is continuous. This finally means that $\psi^{-1}$ is also continuous, as it is the following composition:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
U\times\mathbb{R}^n\ar[r]&U\times GL(n)\times\mathbb{R}^n\ar[r]&U\times\mathbb{R}^n\\[-1.5em]
(x,v)\ar[r,mapsto]&(x,\psi_x^{-1},v)\ar[r,mapsto]&(x,\psi_x^{-1}v)\ar[r,phantom,"="]&[-2em]\psi^{-1}(x,v)
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
Thus, $\phi^{-1}$ is also continuous, which proves the claim.
\end{proof}

This means that in order to distinguish between non-isomorphic vector bundles we need to examine them globally and a natural way to start doing this is to introduce the notion of a section. This is a continuous choice of an element inside every fiber over all points of the base space:

\begin{definition} Let $\xi:E\to B$ be a vector bundle. A \emph{cross section} or just \emph{section} $s:B\to E$ is a continuous right inverse of $\xi$, i.e. a continuous function taking each $x\in B$ to an element in $\xi^{-1}(x)$.
\end{definition}

Notice that the same definition of a section applies generally for fiber bundles, but in the case of vector bundles we can use the vector structure to measure how many independent sections we can find in a space:

\begin{definition} Let $\xi:E\to B$ be a vector bundle and $s_1,\ldots,s_k:B\to E$ $k$ sections of $\xi$. Then $\{s_1,\ldots,s_k\}$ are \emph{nowhere dependent sections} if for each $x\in B$ the vectors $\{s_1(x),\ldots,s_k(x)\}$ are linearly independent. In particular, a nowhere dependent section $s$ is also called \emph{nowhere zero section}.
\end{definition}

Obviously, an $n$-plane vector bundle cannot have more than $n$ nowhere dependent sections and the next lemma asserts that the interesting cases arise when there exist less than $n$ nowhere dependent sections.

\begin{lemma} Let $\xi:E\to B$ be an $n$-plane vector bundle. Then $\xi\cong\varepsilon_B^n$ if and only if there exist $n$ nowhere dependent sections of $\xi$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof} First of all, it is easy to construct $n$ nowhere dependent sections of $\varepsilon_B^n=B\times\mathbb{R}^n$. Indeed, fix some basis $(e_1,\ldots,e_n)$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and let $s_i(x):=(x,e_i)$ for every $x\in B$ and every $i\in[n]$.

On the other hand, let $s_1,\ldots,s_n$ be $n$ nowhere dependent sections of $\xi$. Then, we define $\phi:B\times\mathbb{R}^n\to\varepsilon_B^n$ as follows: Fix $e_1,\ldots,e_n$ to be a base of $\mathbb{R}^n$, define $\phi(x,e_i):=s_i(x)\in\xi^{-1}(x)$ and then extend $\phi$ linearly over each $x\in B$:
\[\phi\left(x,\sum_{i\in[n]}a_ie_i\right)=\sum_{i\in[n]}a_i\phi(x,e_i)=\sum_{i\in[n]}a_is_i(x)\in\xi^{-1}(x)\]
$\phi$ is by definition linear over each fiber and continuous, since every section is continuous, i.e. $\phi$ is a vector bundle map. Each restriction $\phi_x:\{x\}\times\mathbb{R}^n\to\xi^{-1}(x)$ is a linear isomorphism, since $s_1(x),\ldots,s_n(x)$ are linearly independent and $\xi^{-1}(x)$ is $n$-dimensional. Thus, using Proposition~\ref{prop:local_to_global_iso_vector} we get that $\phi$ is a vector bundle isomorphism.
\end{proof}

Let us now use sections to prove that the tautological bundle of a projective space is not trivial.

\begin{proposition} Let $n\geq1$ be any natural number, then $\gamma_n^1\not\cong\varepsilon_{\mathbb{R}P^n}^1$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof} It suffices to prove that there does not exist any section $s$ of $\gamma_n^1$ that is nowhere zero. We will prove this by contradiction: Suppose there exists some continuous map
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\mathbb{R}P^n\ar[r,"s"]&\mathbb{R}P^n\times\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\\[-1.5em]
l\ar[r,mapsto]&(l,\tilde{s}(l))
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
where $\tilde{s}:=\pi_2\circ s$ and $\tilde{s}(l)\in l\setminus\{0\}$ for every $l\in\mathbb{R}P^n$. Let us now precompose $\tilde{s}$ with the quotient map $q:S^n\to\mathbb{R}P^n$ which sends $v\in S^n$ to $\mathrm{span}\{v\}\in\mathbb{R}P^n$ to get $\hat{s}=\tilde{s}\circ q:S^n\to\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Notice that $\hat{s}(v)$ is a non-zero vector in the line spanned by $v$, which means in particular that its inner product with $v$ is not zero. This lets us finally define the following continuous map $t:S^n\to\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}$:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
t\ar[r,phantom,":"]&[-2em]S^n\ar[r,"\left<\hat{s}{,}id\right>"]&\mathbb{R}^{n+1}\times S^n\ar[r,"-^t-"]&\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}\\[-1.5em]
&v\ar[r,mapsto]&\left(\hat{s}(v),v\right)\ar[r,mapsto]&\hat{s}(v)^tv
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
Notice now that for any $v\in\mathbb{R}^n$
\[t(-v)=\hat{s}(-v)^t(-v)=-\tilde{s}(\mathrm{span}\{-v\})^tv=-\tilde{s}(\mathrm{span}\{v\})^tv=-\hat{s}(v)^tv=-t(v)\]
i.e. $t:S^n\to\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}$ is an antipodal map. Since $n\geq1$, $S^n$ is connected and the existance of such a continuous $t$ leads to a contradiction due to the intermediate value theorem. Notice that this is the easiest case of the (BU1b)-version of the Borsuk Ulam theorem as stated in Theorem~2.1.1 in \cite{BU_Matousek}.
\end{proof}

\section{Creating new bundles}
Our goal is now to describe some ways to create new bundles by combining the data of already known ones. First we construct new bundles based on continuous maps between the base spaces, disregarding the vector space structure on the fibers and then we construct new bundles by fixing the base space and doing operations on the vector spaces fiber-wise.

\subsection{By combining the base spaces}
In order to briefly ignore the vector space structure of the fibers we will describe the next few constructions in terms of fiber bundles, in general.

\begin{proposition} Let $p:E\to B$ be a fiber bundle with fiber $F$, let $B'$ be any topological space and let $g:B'\to B$ be any continuous map. Moreover, let $E':=\{(x,v)\in B'\times E:g(x)=p(v)\}$, $g^*p(x,v)=x$ and $\bar{g}(x,v)=v$ be the space and the maps making the following a pullback square of topological spaces:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
E'\ar[r,dotted,"\bar{f}"]\ar[d,dotted,"g^*p"']\ar[rd,phantom,"\lrcorner",near start]&E\ar[d,"p"]\\
B'\ar[r,"g"]&B
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
Then $g^*p:E'\to B'$ is a fiber bundle with fiber $F$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof} We have to show that $g^*p$ as defined above is locally trivial. Let $x\in B'$, then, since $p$ is a fiber bundle, there exists some open $U$ with $g(x)\in U\subseteq B$ and a homeomorphism $f_U:p^{-1}(U)\to U\times F$ such that $p=\pi_1\circ f_U$. Let $U':=g^{-1}(U)$. This contains $x$ and is open, since $g$ is continuous. Notice that
\begin{align*}
(g^*p)^{-1}(U')&=\{(x,v)\in U'\times E: g(x)=p(v)\}\\
&=\{(x,v)\in U'\times p^{-1}(U):g(x)=p(v)\}
\end{align*}
So, we can define $f'_{U'}:= id\times(\pi_2\circ f_U):(g^*p)^{-1}(U')\to U'\times F$. This is a continuous map and obviously satisfies the equation $g^*p(x,a)=x=\pi_1\circ f'_{U'}$. In order to prove that it is also a homeomorphism, we will prove that it has a continuous inverse map. Define $h_{U'}:U'\times F\to (g^*p)^{-1}(U')$ as follows:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
h_{U'}\ar[r,phantom,":"]&[-2em]U'\times F\ar[r,"\left<id_{U'}{,}g\right>\times id_F"]&[3em]U'\times U\times F\ar[r,"id_{U'}\times f_U^{-1}"]&[3em](g^*p)^{-1}(U')\\[-1.5em]
&(x,a)\ar[r,mapsto]&(x,g(x),a)\ar[r,mapsto]&(x,f_U^{-1}(g(x),a))
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
This map is continuous well defined. Indeed, $p\big(f_U^{-1}(g(x),a)\big)=\pi_1(g(x),a)=g(x)$, so $(x,f_U^{-1}(g(x),a))\in (g^*p)^{-1}(U')$ for every $(x,a)\in U'\times F$. Moreover, notice that $(f'_{U'}\circ h_{U'})(x,a)=f'_{U'}(x,f_U^{-1}(g(x),a))=(x,\pi_2\circ f_U\circ f_U^{-1}(g(x),a))=(x,a)$ for every $(x,a)\in U'\times F$. Also, for every $(x,v)\in (g^*p)^{-1}(U')$, we have:
\begin{align*}
(h_{U'}\circ f'_{U'})(x,v)&=h_{U'}(x,\pi_2\circ f_U(v))=\big(x,f_U^{-1}(g(x),\pi_2\circ f_U(v))\big)\\
&=\big(x,f_U^{-1}(p(v),\pi_2\circ f_U(v))\big)=\big(x,f_U^{-1}(\pi_1\circ f_U(v),\pi_2\circ f_U(v))\big)\\
&=\big(x,f_U^{-1}\circ f_U(v)\big)=(x,v)
\end{align*}
which finishes the proof that $(f'_{U'})^{-1}=h_{U'}$
\end{proof}

\begin{definition} Let $p:E\to B$ be a fiber bundle with fiber $F$ and $g:B'\to B$ any continuous map as in the above proposition. The \emph{induced} fiber bundle of $p$ over $g$ is $g^*p:E'\to B'$, where $E':=\{(x,a)\in B'\times E:g(x)=p(a)\}$ and $g^*p(x,a)=x$.
\end{definition}
The way to imagine the pullback fiber bundle is that we attach to a point $x\in B'$ a copy of $F$ ``in the same way'' it is attached to $g(x)$.

\begin{remark} In the special case where $g:B'\to B$ is injective, then $E'\cong p^{-1}(g(B'))\subseteq E$ and $(g^*p)(v)=g^{-1}(p(v))$ for every $v\in p^{-1}(g(B'))$.
\end{remark}
\begin{proof} The function $g$ being injective means that it has a left inverse, which we will denote by $g^{-1}$ here. This means that:
\begin{align*}
E'&=\{(x,v)\in B'\times E:g(x)=p(v)\}=\{(x,v)\in B'\times E:x=(g^{-1}\circ p)(v)\}\\
&\cong\{v\in E:(g^{-1}\circ p)(v)\in B'\}=p^{-1}(g(B))
\end{align*}
And factoring $g^*p$ through this homeomorphism we exactly get $(g^*p)(v)=x=g^{-1}(p(v))$, which proves the assertion.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition} Let $p:E\to B$ be a fiber bundle and $A\subseteq B$ any subset of $B$. Then, the \emph{restriction bundle of $p$ on $A$} is $p|A:E'\to A$, where $E'=p^{-1}(A)$ and $g^*p(v)=p|_{p^{-1}(A)}(v)$.
\end{definition}
Notice that $p|A$ has fiber $F$, which means that we restricted $B$ but not $F$.

\begin{proposition} Let $p_1:E_1\to B_1$ and $p_2:E_2\to B_2$ be two fiber bundles with fibers $F_1$ and $F_2$ respectively. Then $p_1\times p_2:E_1\times E_2\to B_1\times B_2$ is a fiber bundle with fiber $F_1\times F_2$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof} We have to show that $p_1\times p_2$ is locally trivial. Let $(x_1,x_2)\in B_1\times B_2$. Then, since $p_1$ and $p_2$ are fiber bundles there exist some open sets $U_1\subseteq E_1$ and $U_2\subseteq E_2$ with $x_1\in U_1$ and $x_2\in U_2$ and homeomorphisms $f_{U_1}:p_1^{-1}(U_1)\to U_1\times F_1$ and $g_{U_2}:p_2^{-1}(U_2)\to U_2\times F_2$ such that $p_1=\pi_1\circ f_{U_1}$ and $p_2=\pi_1\circ g_{U_2}$. Let $U=U_1\times U_2$. This contains $(x_1,x_2)$ and is open. Notice that $(p_1\times p_2)^{-1}(U)=p_1^{-1}(U_1)\times p_2^{-1}(U_2)$. So, we can define $h_U:=\tau_{2,3}\circ(f_{U_1}\times g_{U_2}):(p_1\times p_2)^{-1}(U)\to U_1\times U_2\times F_1\times F_2$, where $\tau_{2,3}:U_1\times F_1\times U_2\times F_2\to U_1\times U_2\times F_1\times F_2$ is the homeomorphism swapping coordinates $2$ and $3$. This makes $h_U$ a homeomorphism and it is easy to check that $\pi_1\circ h_U(v_1,v_2)=(p_1\times p_2)(v_1,v_2)\in B_1\times B_2$, where $\pi_1$ is the projection on the first two coordinates just for this example.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition} Let $p_1:E_1\to B_1$ and $p_2:E_2\to B_2$ be two fiber bundles with fibers $F_1$ and $F_2$ respectively. Then, the \emph{product fiber bundle of $p_1$ and $p_2$} is the usual product map $p_1\times p_2:E_1\times E_2\to B_1\times B_2$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition} Let $p_1:E_1\to B_1$ and $p_2:E_2\to B_2$ be two fiber bundles both with fiber $F$ and $F$ respectively. Then $p_1\amalg p_2:E_1\amalg E_2\to B_1\amalg B_2$ is a fiber bundle with fiber $F$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof} We have to show that $p_1\amalg p_2:E_1\amalg E_2\to B_1\amalg B_2$ is locally trivial. Let $x\in B_1\amalg B_2$. Then $x\in B_i$ for some $i\in\{1,2\}$ and there exists some open $U\subseteq B_i$ containing $x$ and a homeomorphism $f_U:p_i^{-1}(U)\to U\times F$. Notice that $(p_1\amalg p_2)^{-1}(U)=p_i^{-1}(U)$, so $f_U$ itself is a local homeomorphism for $p_1\amalg p_2$.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition} Let $p_1:E_1\to B_1$ and $p_2:E_2\to B_2$ be two fiber bundles both with fiber $F$. Then, the \emph{coproduct fiber bundle of $p_1$ and $p_2$} is the usual coproduct map $p_1\amalg p_2:E_1\amalg E_2\to B_1\amalg B_2$.
\end{definition}
Notice that the product of the base spaces always defines a product of fiber bundles, but the disjoint union of two base spaces defines a fiber bundle only if the fibers of the two components were already isomorphic.

\subsection{By combining the fibers}
Here we want to exploit the vector space structure of the fibers, so we fix some base space $B$ and define new bundles over $B$ using fiber-wise operations. In this section we are going to construct some vector bundle isomorphisms, always by constructing a bundle map that is linear on the fibers, proving that the desired isomorphism is true fiberwise and then using proposition~\ref{prop:local_to_global_iso_vector} to argue that this bundle map is in fact a bundle isomorphism.

\begin{definition} Let $\xi:E\to B$ be an $n$-plane vector bundle and $\eta:E'\to B$ a $k$-plane vector bundle, where $E'\subseteq E$. Then $\eta$ is a \emph{subbundle of $\xi$}, if $\eta^{-1}(x)<\xi^{-1}(x)$ as vector spaces for every $x\in B$. In this case, we write $\eta<\xi$. Notice that in this case $k\leq n$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition} Let $\xi_1:E_1\to B$ be an $n_1$-plane vector bundle, $\xi_2:E_2\to B$ an $n_2$-plane vector bundle and $\eta:E\to B$ an $n$-plane vector bundle, where $E_1,E_2\subseteq E$. Then $\eta$ is the \emph{whitney sum of $\xi_1$ and $\xi_2$}, if $\eta^{-1}(x)=\xi_1^{-1}(x)\oplus\xi_2^{-1}(x)$ as vector spaces, for every $x\in B$. In this case, we write $\eta=\xi_1\oplus\xi_2$. Notice that in this case $n_1+n_2=n$.
\end{definition}

Next we examine how to explicitly describe the whitney sum of two given bundles:
\begin{proposition} Let $\xi_1:E_1\to B$ be an $n_1$-plane vector bundle and $\xi_2:E_2\to B$ an $n_2$-plane vector bundle. Then, $\xi_1\oplus\xi_2\cong d^*(\xi_1\times\xi_2)$, where $d:B\to B\times B$ is the diagonal map taking $x\in B$ to $(x,x)\in B\times B$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof} Let $d^*(\xi_1\times\xi_2):\big\{(x,v_1,v_2)\in B\times E_1\times E_2:(x,x)=(\xi_1(v_1),\xi_2(v_2))\big\}\to B$ and $\eta=\xi_1\otimes\xi_2:E\to B$. Then, we can define the following map:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\big\{(x,v_1,v_2)\in B\times E_1\times E_2:(x,x)=(\xi_1(v_1),\xi_2(v_2))\big\}\ar[r,"\phi"]&[5em]E\\[-1.5em]
(x,v_1,v_2)\ar[r,mapsto]&v_1+v_2
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
It is easy to see that this is a bundle map and linear over each fiber. Next, notice that its restriction on the fibers $\phi_x=\phi|:\big(d^*(\xi_1\times\xi_2)\big)^{-1}(x)\to\eta^{-1}(x)$ is a linear isomorphism. Indeed, for any $x\in B$, its inverse is the map $\psi_x$ taking some $v\in\eta^{-1}(x)$, writing it as $v_1+v_2\in\xi_1^{-1}(x)\oplus\xi_2^{-1}(x)$ and mapping it to $(x,v_1,v_2)\in B\times E_1\times E_2$. We use now Proposition~\ref{prop:local_to_global_iso_vector} to glue all $\psi_x$ in one global $\psi$ inverse of $\phi$, which proves the assertion.
\end{proof}
\begin{remark} We can write $\xi_1\oplus\xi_2:\big\{(v_1,v_2)\in E_1\times E_2:\xi_1(v_1)=\xi_2(v_2)\big\}\to B$, where $(\xi_1\oplus\xi_2)(v_1,v_2)=\xi_1(v_1)$.
\end{remark}
\begin{proof} By the construction of the product and the induced bundle, we have that $d^*(\xi_1\times\xi_2):E\to B$, where
\begin{align*}
E&=\big\{(x,v_1,v_2)\in B\times E_1\times E_2:(x,x)=(\xi_1(v_1),\xi_2(v_2))\big\}\\
&=\big\{(\xi_1(v_1),v_1,v_2)\in B\times E_1\times E_2:\xi_1(v_1)=\xi_2(v_2)\big\}\\
&\cong\big\{(v_1,v_2)\in E_1\times E_2:\xi_1(v_1)=\xi_2(v_2)\big\}
\end{align*}
and factoring $\xi_1\oplus\xi_2$ through this homeomorphism gives exactly $(\xi_1\oplus\xi_2)(v_1,v_2)=x=\xi_1(v_1)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition} Let $\xi:E\to B$ be an $n$-plane vector bundle, $\xi':E'\to B$ a $k$-plane vector bundle and $\eta:Q\to B$ an $m$-plane vector bundle, where $E'\subseteq E$. Then $\eta$ is the \emph{quotient vector bundle of $\xi$ and $\xi'$}, if $\eta^{-1}(x)=\sfrac{\xi^{-1}(x)}{\xi'^{-1}(x)}$ as vector spaces, for every $x\in B$. In this case, we write $\eta=\sfrac{\xi}{\xi'}$. Notice that in this case $n-k=m$.
\end{definition}
Next we examine how to explicitly define the quotient bundles given a bundle and a subbundle.
\begin{proposition} Let $\xi:E\to B$ be an $n$-plane vector bundle and $\xi':E'\to B$ a $k$-plane vector subbundle, i.e. $\xi'\leq\xi$. Then, $\sfrac{\xi}{\xi'}\cong\eta:\sfrac{E}{\sim}\to B$, where $v_1\sim v_2$ iff $\xi(v_1)=\xi(v_2)$ and $v_1-v_2\in\xi'^{-1}(\xi(v))$ and $\left(\sfrac{\xi}{\xi'}\right)([v])=\xi(v)$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof} First of all notice that this map is well defined, since $\xi(v)$ is the same for every choice of class representative $v$. Let $\sfrac{\xi}{\xi'}:Q\to B$ be the definition of the quotient vector bundle. We define now the following map:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzcd}
\sfrac{E}{\sim}\ar[r,"\phi"]&Q\\[-1.5em]
[v]\ar[r,mapsto]&v+\xi'^{-1}(\xi(v))
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
Notice that this is continuous and well defined, by the definition of the equivalence relation and also linear over each fiber. Next, we want to prove that it is in fact a vector isomorphism over each fiber. To do this, we will define for every $x\in B$ its inverse $\psi_x$. Let $v+\xi'^{-1}(x)\in\sfrac{\xi^{-1}(x)}{\xi'^{-1}(x)}$, then we define $\psi_x(v+\xi'^{-1}(x))=[v]$. This is again well defined and is easy to see that it is the desired inverse. Remark~\ref{rem:vector_subcover} lets us now glue all $\psi_x$ into one global inverse of $\phi$, which proves that $\phi$ is a vector bundle isomorphism. Factoring $\sfrac{\xi}{\xi'}$ over this homeomorphism, we get $\left(\sfrac{\xi}{\xi'}\right)([v])=x=\xi(v)$ as desired.
\end{proof}
