In this thesis our goal is to study the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Cohomology of the real Grassmannian manifolds $Gr_{\mathbb{R}}(k,\mathbb{R}^n)$. In the first chapter we define these manifolds as topological spaces and study their Shubert-cell structure. In the second chapter we first state some known results on vector bundles, in order to be able to study the notion of characteristic classes and in particular Stiefel-Whitney classes. In the third chapter we summarize some algebraic results that are needed for our computation and finally, in the last chapter we are going to fully describe the Cohomology algebra of the real Grassmannians on $\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients.
