\chapter*{Abstract}
The purpose of this thesis is to completely describe the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-algebra structure of the Cohomology ring with $\mathbb{Z}_2$-coefficients of the real infinite Grassmannian. In order to achieve that, we first define and explore the notions of the Grassmannian and of a vector bundle. Then, we study in detail the Stiefel-Whitney classes, by defining them explicitly, proving their existence and their uniqueness.
