\section*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank my supervisors Prof. Blagojevi\'c and Prof. Florian Frick for the helpful and caring environment they provided me during the time the thesis was being written, but also before.

I am also especially grateful to Katerina Niklanovits for supporting, helping me and being there for me through all the years. Also, I am very thankful to my parents and sister for always taking care of me.
